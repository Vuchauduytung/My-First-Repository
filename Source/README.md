--------------------------- Ultra high frequency techniques Project -----------------------------------

1. Goal of the project: 
    - Calculate the length of the wire on the main branch and stub to obtain maximum power

2. How to use:
    - Install all necessary frameworks in Software_Requirements.md file
    - Go to the directory of this file and type:
        >> python ImpedanceMatching_caculate.py <solution-filename> <show-solution>
        Note: <solution-filename>: Name of the solution file that contains the process of wire analysis
                <show-solution>: "show_solution" if you want to display the result on the screen or leave it blank 
                                    if you don't
    - Solution file will be saved in the Solution folder
